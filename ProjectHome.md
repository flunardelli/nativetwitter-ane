Adobe AIR ANE for iOS devices that allows developers to use the native Twitter framework added in iOS 5.0.

The ANE is highly based on the PhoneGap plugin made by Antonelli Brian, it's been updated to use Twitter v1.1 API and take into account multiple accounts set up in the device among other minor improvements and fixes.

ANE developed for [PalDeveloppers](http://www.paldeveloppers.com).
